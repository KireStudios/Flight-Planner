# Airspace Route Explorer - Version 4

## Project Overview
This project is a Python application developed for Informàtica 1 (2024-25 Q2) that allows users to explore routes in airspace by manipulating and visualizing graph structures. The tool enables operations such as finding optimal routes between waypoints, with this fourth version adding new functionalities like waypoints, google earth's integration and visual upgrades.

## Features
- Graph representation with waypoints and segments (paths between waypoints)
- NavPoint class implementation with coordinates
- NavSegment class implementation with cost calculation
- NavAirport class implementation with cost calculation
- AirSpace operations including:
  - Adding/removing waypoints and segments
  - Visualizing graphs with different display options
  - Showing the reachable waypoints from another one
  - Finding the shortest path between two waypoints
- Graphical user interface (Tkinter) for user-friendly interaction

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
3. Install required dependencies: ``` pip install matplotlib tkinter ```

## Usage
Run the main interface:
    ```
    python interface.py
    ```

The GUI allows you to:
- Load and display example graphs
- Create custom graphs
- Save and load graphs from files
- Visualize node neighborhoods
- Interactively add/remove waypoints and segments
- Interactively add/remove waypoints and segments
- Reachability analisis from a node
- Shortest path finding using A* algorithm

Extra features:
- Shortest path allows waypoint adding
- Hidding and showing elements in graphs and google earth
- Node searching and editing
- Music and visual upgrade
