# Airspace Route Explorer - Version 2

## Project Overview
This project is a Python application developed for Informàtica 1 (2024-25 Q2) that allows users to explore routes in airspace by manipulating and visualizing graph structures. The tool enables operations such as finding optimal routes between waypoints, with this second version adding new functionalities like being able to see which nodes can be reached from a certain waypoint and finding the shortest path between two of them.

## Version Information
- **Version 2 generated by**: Alex Sanz Rautiainen
- **Version 2 verified by**: Adrià Martínez Mirabent
- **Version 2 communicated by**: Èrik Ventura Gili
- **URL del video**: [\[v2.0 video\]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O8Go5HUI1ydZk-_JSFxYFWivF2LalkMb/view?usp=drive_link)

## Features
- Graph representation with nodes (waypoints) and segments (paths between waypoints)
- Node class implementation with coordinates and neighbor management
- Segment class implementation with cost calculation
- Graph operations including:
  - Adding/removing nodes and segments
  - Finding closest nodes to given coordinates
  - Visualizing graphs with different display options
  - Showing the reachable nodes from another one
  - Finding the shortest path between two nodes
- Graphical user interface (Tkinter) for user-friendly interaction

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
3. Install required dependencies: ``` pip install matplotlib tkinter ```

## Usage
Run the main interface:
    ```
    python interface.py
    ```

The GUI allows you to:
- Load and display example graphs
- Create custom graphs
- Save and load graphs from files
- Visualize node neighborhoods
- Interactively add/remove nodes and segments
- Reachability analisis from a node
- Shortest path finding using A* algorithm

## Next Steps
Future versions will implement:
- Integration with real airspace data
- Google Earth visualization capabilities
